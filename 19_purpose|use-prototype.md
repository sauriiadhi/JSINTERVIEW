# purpose of the prototype property  

In JavaScript, the `prototype` property is used in constructor functions to establish the prototype of objects created by that constructor. The primary purpose of the `prototype` property is to enable prototypal inheritance and shared behavior among instances of objects.

Here are the key purposes of the `prototype` property:

1.  **Prototypal Inheritance:**
    
    -   The `prototype` property allows you to define properties and methods that will be shared among all instances created by a constructor function.
    -   When you create an object using the `new` keyword with a constructor function, the new object inherits properties and methods from the constructor's prototype.
2.  **Shared Methods:**
    
    -   By adding methods to the constructor's prototype, you ensure that all instances created by that constructor share the same set of methods.
    -   This promotes code reusability and more efficient memory usage, as the methods are shared among instances rather than being duplicated for each instance.
3.  **Efficient Memory Usage:**
    
    -   Methods added to the prototype are stored in memory only once, and all instances reference the same set of methods through the prototype chain.
    -   This can result in more efficient memory usage compared to adding methods directly to each instance.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the use of the `prototype` property:

```javascript
// Constructor function
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

// Adding a method to the constructor's prototype
Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + " years old.");
};

// Creating instances
var person1 = new Person("John", 25);
var person2 = new Person("Alice", 30);

// Using the shared method
person1.sayHello(); // Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
person2.sayHello(); // Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.

```
