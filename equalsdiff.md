# Difference Between == and === in JavaScript

In JavaScript, `==` and `===` are both used for comparison, but they have significant differences in terms of type coercion and strict equality. Here's a breakdown of their dissimilarities:

## Loose Equality (==):

- The `==` operator performs type coercion, attempting to convert operands to the same type before making the comparison.

- If the operands are of different types, JavaScript will try to convert them to a common type.

- While type coercion can be convenient, it may lead to unexpected results, and it's essential to be cautious when using `==`.

- For example:
  ```javascript
  '5' == 5;  // true (string '5' is coerced to a number)
    ```

## Strict Equality (===):

- The `===` operator, also known as strict equality, does not perform type coercion. It checks for equality of both value and type.

- If the operands are of different types, `===`returns false without attempting to convert them.

- Strict equality is generally considered safer and more predictable because it avoids implicit type conversions.

- For example:
  ```javascript
  '5' === 5;  // false (string '5' is string)
    ```
